info dump from website, need to summarize-


The dataset for this project is sourced from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a federally funded research and development centor administered by the California Institute of Technology founded in 1936.

The laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. JPL’s Solar System Dynamics (SSD) group is part of Mission Design and Navigation section. The SSD group focuses on determining the motion and physical parameters of natural planetary objects.
The SSD group generates accurate position and velocity histories (ephemerides), gravity fields, and rotational parameters for solar system bodies including the planets, planetary satellites, asteroids and comets. 
The SSD group also performs scientific research and provides science support and leaders to mission studies involving gravity science, celestial mechanics, relativity, and other areas of dynamical science. Specific responsibilities of the group are to:

Continually update and improve the ephemerides using new data and new data types.
Export ephemerides to flight projects of all space faring nations and to an international community of scientists.
Maintain up-to-date orbit and physical data files for planets, satellites, asteroids, and comets for mission design work.
Assume lead role in defining fundamental coordinate systems and physical constants for solar system bodies.
Coordinate ground-based observing programs for solar system bodies that may become future mission targets.
Help plan future missions to study the asteroids and comets of the solar system and investigate fundamental gravitational theory.
Conduct research and plan missions to probe the interior of planetary bodies by determining the gravity field, shape, and rotational parameters.
Conduct research and plan missions to test certain areas of fundamental physics including the equivalence principle and gravitational waves.

For this website, we define the term “Small Body” to include all natural bodies that are not a planet or natural satellite. This usually means all asteroids and comets, but can also include dwarf planets (e.g., Ceres) as small bodies. The IAU defines a slighly different term “Small Solar System Bodies” which excludes dwarf planets. See IAU resolution B5.


Why Study Asteroids?
Donald K. Yeomans — April 1998

The scientific interest in asteroids is due largely to their status as the remnant debris from the inner solar system formation process. Because some of these objects can collide with the Earth, asteroids are also important for having significantly modified the Earth’s biosphere in the past. They will continue to do so in the future. In addition, asteroids offer a source of volatiles and an extraordinarily rich supply of minerals that can be exploited for the exploration and colonization of our solar system in the twenty-first century.

Asteroids represent the bits and pieces left over from the process that formed the inner planets, including Earth. Asteroids are also the sources of most meteorites that have struck the Earth’s surface and many of these meteorites have already been subjected to detailed chemical and physical analyses. If certain asteroids can be identified as the sources for some of the well-studied meteorites, the detailed knowledge of the meteorite’s composition and structure will provide important information on the chemical mixture, and conditions from which the Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. During the early solar system, the carbon-based molecules and volatile materials that served as the building blocks of life may have been brought to the Earth via asteroid and comet impacts. Thus the study of asteroids is not only important for studying the primordial chemical mixture from which the Earth formed, these objects may hold the key as to how the building blocks of life were delivered to the early Earth.

On a daily basis, the Earth is bombarded with tons of interplanetary material. Many of the incoming particles are so small that they are destroyed in the Earth’s atmosphere before they reach the ground. These particles are often seen as meteors or shooting stars. The vast majority of all interplanetary material that reaches the Earth’s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago. With an average interval of about 100 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 50 meters would be expected to reach the Earth’s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every few hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a mile could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth’s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth’s surface. The probability of an asteroid striking the Earth and causing serious damage is very remote but the devastating consequences of such an impact suggests we should closely study different types of asteroids to understand their compositions, structures, sizes, and future trajectories.

The asteroids that are potentially the most hazardous because they can closely approach the Earth are also the objects that could be most easily exploited for raw materials. These raw materials could be used in developing the space structures and in generating the rocket fuel that will be required to explore and colonize our solar system in the twenty-first century. By closely investigating the compositions of asteroids, intelligent choices can be made as to which ones offer the richest supplies of raw materials. It has been estimated that the mineral wealth resident in the belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter would be equivalent to about 100 billion dollars for every person on Earth today.
